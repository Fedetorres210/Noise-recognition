# Noise Recognition: Audio Events

### The idea of ​​this project is to create a model that is capable of recognizing the different sounds in an environment. In order to find this model, different models will be used, looking for the one that works best, at the same time the TensorFlow library will be used to create a neural network and compare if the model is better than said network.

## UrbanSound8K Dataset

This dataset contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes: air_conditioner, car_horn, children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, enginge_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street_music. The classes are drawn from the urban sound taxonomy. For a detailed description enter the following links:
